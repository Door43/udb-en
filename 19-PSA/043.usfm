\s5
\c 43

\p
\p
\v 1 God, declare that I am innocent.
Defend me when people say things against meâ€”those people who do not honor you!
Rescue me from people who deceive me and say things about me that are not true.
\v 2 You are God, the one who protects me;
why have you abandoned me?
It does not seem right that I should always have to be sad
because of my enemies acting cruelly toward me.

\s5
\v 3 Speak true words that help me to live. 
Give a command that will allow me to go back to Zion, your sacred hill in Jerusalem,
and to your temple where you live.
\v 4 When you do that, I will go to your altar
to worship you, my God, who causes me to be very joyful.
There I will praise you, the God whom I worship, and I will play my harp.


\s5
\v 5 So why am I sad and discouraged?
I confidently expect God to bless me,
and again I will praise him,
my God, the one who saves me.
