\c 22
\q1
\v 1 Being a person who keeps his word is more important than having great riches,
\q2 and being a person who everyone respects for doing right, is better than having silver and gold.
\b
\q1
\v 2 People who are rich and people who are poor have at least one thing in common—
\q2 Yahweh made both of them.
\b

\s5
\q1
\v 3 One who has good sense takes cover when he sees trouble coming,
\q2 but those who have no experience or knowledge rush ahead into danger.
\q1
\v 4 When a person is humble and gives Yahweh the respect he deserves,
\q2 these are his rewards: riches, and honor, and life.

\s5
\q1
\v 5 Where the perverse walk, their way is like a road covered with thorns, and there are traps in every step.
\q2 When you guard your own life from evil, you will stay away from all these dangers.
\q1
\v 6 A child must be shown the way to live and the direction he should go,
\q2 and when he reaches old age, he will stay on that same path.

\s5
\q1
\v 7 The fact is that the rich often have power over the poor,
\q2 and one who borrows money is almost like a slave to the one who lends him the money.
\q1
\v 8 If you plant the seeds of wickedness, you can expect a crop of trouble,
\q2 and when you use a rod to discipline your child,
\q2 but you use it when you are furious, it will do no good.
\s5
\q1
\v 9 The one who looks for people to help, Yahweh will give many good gifts,
\q2 because he considered it important to share his food with the poor.
\q1
\v 10 If you throw out the conceited person, out will go all kinds of conflict with him.
\q2 No one will quarrel or insult anyone else when he is gone.

\s5
\q1
\v 11 When a person loves to do something just because he wants to do what is good and right—
\q2 he is sincere, and his speech is filled with kindness
\q2 —the king will be his friend.
\b
\q1
\v 12 Yahweh gives protection to knowledge, to keep it safe,
\q2 just as surely as he makes the lying promises of the betrayer fail.
\s5
\q1
\v 13 A lazy person calls out, "There is a lion in the street! If I go out, I will be killed!"
\q1
\v 14 The words spoken by an adulteress will draw you in, and it will be as if you have fallen into a deep and dangerous pit!
\q2 All those who fall into that pit will be in trouble,
\q2 but what is worse, they will experience Yahweh's anger for what they have done.
\s5
\q1
\v 15 Stupid and silly things are bound up within a child,
\q2 and they come out in foolishness;
\q2 but correcting a child with discipline drives the folly far away.
\q1
\v 16 The one who makes his money by taking advantage of the poor,
\q2 or by giving more money to the wealthy,
\q2 Yahweh will bring him into poverty.
\s5
\q1
\v 17 Now listen to what those who are wise have said;
\q2 give it all your attention and learn the knowledge you will need if you are to become wise.
\q1
\v 18 It will be good for you to make them the guiding principles you live by,
\q2 and be able to repeat all of them to others.
\q1
\v 19 The most important thing is for you to trust in Yahweh,
\q2 and so I am teaching them to you, yes, even to you.
\s5
\q1
\v 20 I have written thirty of these sayings for you to learn;
\q2 sayings to give you advice and to teach you what you do not know.
\q1
\v 21 These lessons show you what is true and they teach you with faithful lessons,
\q2 so you may give reliable and true answers to those who sent you.

\s5
\q1
\v 22 Anyone can rob a poor person. Do not do it.
\q2 And do not hurt them who are begging at the city gate,
\q1
\v 23 for Yahweh stands to defend them,
\q2 and he will take the life of those who stole from the poor.
\s5
\q1
\v 24 Do not become a friend with one whose life is controlled by his anger,
\q2 and do not associate with a person who rages in his terrible wrath,
\q1
\v 25 or you will learn to be like him,
\q2 and your anger will become like a trap, a trap that will take charge of your life.
\s5
\q1
\v 26 Be careful that you do not shake hands and promise to pay for the debts of others,
\q2 and do not make or sign a pledge so another person can take out a loan.
\q1
\v 27 For if you cannot pay it back,
\q2 they will surely come and take away everything from you, even your bed on which you sleep.

\s5
\q1
\v 28 The ancient boundary stones show where the property lines are. Do not take them away or move them. Your ancestors put them there. Leave them alone.
\q1
\v 29 One who learns a trade and is skillful at it will become a servant of kings.
\q2 Because of his achievements he will not serve mere ordinary people.
