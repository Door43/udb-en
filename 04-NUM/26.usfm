\p
\v 1 After the plague ended, Yahweh said to Eleazar and Moses,
\v 2 "Count all the people of Israel again. Write down the names of all the men who are at least 20 years old who are able to fight in battles, along with their family names."

\s5
\v 3 So while the Israelites were on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho, Eleazar and Moses told this to the Israelite leaders,
\v 4 "Write down the names of all the Israelite men who are at least 20 years old, as Yahweh has commanded us."
\p So they did that, and this is a record of all the descendants of Jacob who came out of Egypt who were still alive.

\s5
\p
\v 10 But the earth opened up and swallowed them and Korah. Yahweh also sent a fire that burned up 250 men who supported those three men. That was a warning to all the Israelite people that they should respect and obey the leaders whom Yahweh had appointed.

\s5
\p
\v 52 Then Yahweh said to Moses,
\v 53 "Divide Canaan land among the tribes. Distribute the land according to the number of people in each tribe that are on your lists.

\s5
\v 54-56 Decide by casting lots to determine which group will get which area, but give the largest areas to the groups with the most people."

\s5
\p
\v 57 The leaders also counted the male descendants of Levi. They were in clans descended from Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
\v 58 These also included people from the clans of Libni, Hebron, Mahli, Mushi, and Korah. All of them were descendants of Levi. Kohath was the ancestor of Amram,
\v 59 whose wife was Jochebed. She also was a descendant of Levi, but she was born in Egypt. She and Amram had two sons, Aaron and Moses, and their older sister Miriam.

\s5
\v 60 Aaron's sons were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
\v 61 But Nadab and Abihu died when they burned incense for a sacrifice to Yahweh in a way that disobeyed what Yahweh had commanded.
\p
\v 62 The leaders counted twenty-three thousand men from the descendants of Levi who were at least one month old. But these men were not counted when the rest of the Israelite people were counted, because were not given any land at that time.

\s5
\p
\v 63 Those were the men whom Eleazar and Moses said should be counted. They counted the Israelite people on the plains of Moab, on the east side of the Jordan River, across from Jericho.
\v 64 None of the men whom they counted were on the lists that were made by Aaron and Moses when the Israelites were in the Sinai Desert.

\s5
\v 65 They were told what Yahweh had said. He said, "They will all die in this desert," and that is what happened. The only ones who were still alive were Jephunneh's son Caleb and Nun's son Joshua.
