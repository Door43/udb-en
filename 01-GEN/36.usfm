\v 1 These are those who descended from Esau, whose other name was Edom, and what happened concerning them.
\v 2 Esau married three women from Canaan land: Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite; Oholibamah, who was the daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hittite;
\v 3 and Basemath, who was the daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.

\v 4 Esau's wife Adah gave birth to Eliphaz. Basemath gave birth to Reuel.
\v 5 Oholibamah gave birth to Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. All these sons of Esau were born while he was living in Canaan land.

\s5
\p
\v 6-7 Jacob and Esau had very many possessions. For this reason, they needed more land for their livestock. The land where they were living was not big enough for all their livestock. So Esau, whose other name was Edom, had taken his wives and sons and daughters and all the other members of his household, his sheep and goats and his other animals, and all the other things he had obtained in Canaan land, and they had moved to an area that was away from Jacob.
\v 8 They went to live in the hill country of Seir.
