\p
\v 18 This is the account of what happened just before Jesus Christ was born. Mary, his mother, had promised to marry Joseph, but before they lived together as husband and wife, they found out that she was expecting a child by the Holy Spirit's power.
\v 19 Now Joseph, who was to be her husband,  was a man who obeyed God's commands, so he decided not to marry her. But he did not want to shame her in front of other people. So he decided to quietly drop his plans to marry her.
\s5
\v 20 While he was seriously considering this, an angel whom the Lord sent surprised him in a dream. The angel said, "Joseph, descendant of King David, do not be afraid to marry Mary. For what has been conceived in her is there by the Holy Spirit. 

\v 21 She will give birth to a son. Since it is he who will save his people from their sins, name him 'Jesus.'"

\s5
\v 22 All this happened to make come true what the Lord told the prophet Isaiah to write long ago. Isaiah wrote,
\v 23 "Listen, a virgin will become pregnant and will give birth to a son. They will call him Immanuel"â€”which means, "God is with us."

\s5
\v 24 When Joseph got up from sleep, he did what the angel had commanded him to do. He began to live with Mary as his wife.
\v 25 But he did not sleep with her until she had given birth to a son. And Joseph named him Jesus.
